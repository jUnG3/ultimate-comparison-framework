> This is the ultimate comparison framework written in [Angular](https://angular.io/).
> It is released on npm as [ultimate-comparison](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ultimate-comparison).

## Create your own ultimate comparison

1. Install the **ultimate-comparison** package globally on your system using `npm install --global ultimate-comparison`
2. Create the directory which should contain the comparison and change into it, e. g. with `mkdir MY_COMPARISON && cd MY_COMPARISON`
3. Set up your comparison with `uc setup`
    1. Enter the name of your comparison and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    2. Enter the [semantic version](https://semver.org/) of your comparison and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
    3. Enter a short description of your comparison and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (not required)
4. Make sure a `node_modules` directory exists as sub directory.
    - If it doesn't exist look at the error message and run `npm install` afterwards
    - The error is most likely a malformed name or version of your comparison
5. Run `uc start` to start the comparison.

### Configuration

The configuration files are located in the `configuration` directory.

`description.md`: It contains the description of your comparison which can be seen by visitors.
It is located underneath the headline of your comparison.

`comparison.yml`: The used configuration. Missing values are taken from `comparison-default.yml` and written back into this file.
A `comparison.yml` has following attributes:

### Define comparison elements

For each thing, create a markdown file in comparison-elements.
You can base it on template.md.
If one column depends on a repository (repo-attribute in `comparison.yml` true), you have to define a `## Repo` section and add the repository as first list item, eg:

```markdown
## Repo
- https://github.com/ultimate-comparisons/ultimate-comparison-BASE
```

## Update your comparison

To update the ultimate comparison framework that your comparison uses, just run `npm update` in the directory that contains your comparison.
It installs the latest version with the same major version number (ie. `2.x.x`).
